=================
In this project, we updated Dr. Prasun Sinha's CSE page.
To run, install middleman: 'gem intstall middleman'. Then navigate to the Project4 directory and run 'bundle exec middleman build' and 'bundle exec middleman server'. This command should display a local IP address where the application is hosted. Navigate to the 'homePage.html' page on that address in FireFox. The address should look something like 'http://0.0.0.0:4567/homePage.html'.
