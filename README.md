=================
In this project, we updated Dr. Prasun Sinha's CSE page (http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~prasun/).


To run, install middleman: 'gem intstall middleman'. Run 'middleman init Project4' while in this directory. Then change to the Project4 directory and run 'bundle exec middleman build' and 'bundle exec middleman server'. This command should display a local IP address where the application is hosted. The address should look something like 'http://0.0.0.0:4567' and you should see Dr. Prasun Sinha's newly renovated webpage.
